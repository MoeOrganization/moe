# Moe Project Status

This is a very, very, very early stage of this project, so please do
not judge too harshly.

Currently we have the following:

* a runtime, which I am fairly happy with (still needs some work, but I
  think the core is where I would like it to be)
* an AST, which I know is still missing a lot of stuff, but again I have
  a foundation
* an Interpreter, this just evaluates the AST and is only like 20% of the
  AST at the moment, but is a start (and an easy place for people to
  start hacking)
* no parser at all to speak of

MORE DETAIL TO COME SOON!
